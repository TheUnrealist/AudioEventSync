## Audio Event Sync in Unreal Engine 4

This is the sample Unreal Engine 4 project I created as part of this YouTube tutorial: [Sync Events To Audio In Unreal Engine 4.13 ](https://youtu.be/w0d_uw0vQoA)

You may use this project in any way you like.

The wonderful free balloon dog model used in this demo was made by Bassam Kurdali, commissioned by Rob Myers. If you'd like to use it in your own projects see the attribution requirements here...
